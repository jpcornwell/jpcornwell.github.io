I love to learn new things, but as of late, I feel that I have grown complacent
in this regard.  The creation of this website marks the beginning of my efforts
to change that.

Firstly, this website will serve as a means of hosting and sharing the new
projects I work on. You can expect online emulators and games at first, but
then I hope to expand this to other types of items such as visualization tools
and study tools that may be helpful for myself or others.

Secondly, I envision this website as being a log recording my learning
endeavors.  This will most likely be in the form of how-tos or recommended
readings because these are the kinds of posts I enjoy reading on the blogs of
other people. This should also help solidify my understanding of the topics
that I study. I have found that I don't understand something as well as I think
I do unless I can at least explain the subject to someone else in my own words.
The topics I will cover will be ones I am interested in. They may be
programming topics like AI, crypto, emulation, graphics, language
design/implementation, and reverse engineering, or non-programming topics like
history, philosophy, video games, economics, the Japanese language, etc.

Finally, if I write regularly on this website, it should help to improve my
writing ability.
