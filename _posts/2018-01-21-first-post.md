I love to learn new things, especially when it comes to programming, but as of
late, I feel that I have grown complacent and not pushed myself as hard as I
should to improve my programming ability.  The creation of this website marks
the beginning of my efforts to change that.

Firstly, this website will serve as a means of hosting and sharing the new
projects I work on. You can expect online emulators and games at first, but
then I hope to expand this to other types of items such as visualization tools
and study tools that may be helpful for myself or others.

Secondly, I envision this website as being a log recording my learning
endeavors.  This will most likely be in the form of how-tos or recommended
readings because these are the kinds of posts I enjoy reading on other
websites. By creating these posts, I hope to solidify my understanding of the
topics that I write about. Being able to explain a subject in your own words is
absolutely essential in truly understanding that subject.

The topics I will cover will be ones I am interested in. Programming topics
that I find really enjoyable include AI, crypto, emulation, graphics, language
design/implementation, and reverse engineering. That being said though, I may
also explore non-programming topics such as history, philosophy, video games,
economics, the Japanese language, etc.

As a side benefit to all of this, if I write regularly on this website, it
should help to improve my writing skills.
