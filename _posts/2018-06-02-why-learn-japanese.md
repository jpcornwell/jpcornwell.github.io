If you are wanting to learn a new language, and are considering Japanese, then
maybe this post will convince you to continue down that path. Below are some of
the reasons I find Japanese an appealing option. Ultimately though, the best
choice will always be the language you are the most likely to stick with, so it
is important that you take the time to recognize what motivates you.


Japanese is different
---------------------

Since Japanese is not a part of the Indo-European family of languages, it
contains some features that can feel quite alien. This is good though, because
it opens up your mind to new concepts that you never would have known existed.
It also makes studying the language more interesting.

For example, a portion of the language that you will spend a lot of time on is
the writing system. Japanese employs three different scripts and one of these
is called Kanji, which consists of thousands of characters. This may seem
daunting, but it is also really cool.

This in conjunction with an abundance of new and foreign grammatical concepts
will ensure that every day you spend studying Japanese is an adventure.


Japanese isn't that difficult
-----------------------------

Many potential learners get scared off by the perceived difficulty of the
language, but a lot of this is overblown. Of course learning a new language is
difficult, but Japanese is not necessarily harder than the others.

One of the first things you may notice is that the pronunciation of the
language is very easy. There is only one real hurdle that most learners need to
get past, which is the 'R' sound. After that, it is smooth sailing. Also, you
will be relieved to see that pronunciation and spelling rules are consistent.
Unlike English, which is absolutely littered with exceptions, in Japanese if
you see a word, you are pretty much guaranteed to know how to correctly say it.

Also, you can take heart from the fact that Japanese grammar omits a lot of
rules that give headaches in other languages. You will never need to memorize
which words are masculine and which are feminine, you won't struggle with verb
conjugations based on the various pronoun categories, and you can often drop
pieces of a sentence entirely if it can be inferred by context what they are.

Even the difficulty of learning Kanji, which is herladed as the most painful
part of learning Japanese, can be reduced if you take the right approach. Books
like James Heisigâ€™s 'Remembering the Kanji' and online services like WaniKani
have made it possible to learn Kanji quickly and easily.


Japanese is aesthetically pleasing
----------------------------------

The language is one you can really drink in. The script is beautiful and the
sound it produces is pleasing to the ear.


The culture is interesting
--------------------------

Typically the biggest motivator for people when learning a language is the
culture behind it, and Japan certainly has no shortage of that. There are
already plenty of articles that extol Japan's culture and the enormous
influence the country has had on the world, so I won't try to duplicate that
here. Suffice it to say there is probably some aspect of the culture that you
will find interesting.
