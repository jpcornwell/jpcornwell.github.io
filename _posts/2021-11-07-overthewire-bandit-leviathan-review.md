The Bandit and Leviathan wargames on overthewire.org are fun newbie
challenges to help get you started on security games. Though these go more into
Linux fundamentals than they do actual security topics, they still are a good
place to start. Playing these will help teach you a few things, but the most
valuable lesson it gives is the importance of figuring things out on your own.
The player is pushed to research commands via the man pages.

Bandit is the first in the sequence of games on the website. It holds your
hand pretty well, and offers tips for what commands will be useful. It's
somewhat lengthy and has a good variety of things to do. Leviathan comes next,
and though it doesn't offer any hints at all, it is much shorter. After
finishing Bandit, you should zoom through Leviathan pretty quickly. The only
possible hangup is a beginner may have trouble if they aren't familiar with
ltrace or strace. That's the only hint I'll give though.

If you want to learn more about Linux or computer security, and don't have
any experience, then these are highly recommended.
