About Me
--------

My name is Jacob Cornwell.

I used to work as a software engineer for the Bombardier Flight Test Center
where I wrote and maintained mission critical software used for the testing and
certification of experimental type aircraft.

Now I work for NetApp. When I first joined, I contributed to the E-Series
product line, which is a SAN storage platform that delivers the best price for
performance ratio in the world. Several years later I switched over to the
company's flagship product, ONTAP, which is a highly specialized operating
system for storage servers and cloud.

Here is a link to my GitHub profile.

About the Website
-----------------

On this website you can expect to see three main types of content. Writeups,
demos, and articles.

Writeups are for me and are basically a log of the various projects I tackle.
This forces me to give a little bit of thought afterwards and the posts may
prove to be interesting to look back on in the future.

Demos will be my projects that are easily shown off through a browser. There
might be some fun things like games.

Articles will be in depth excursions into a given topic. They are again, mostly
for me, to help solidify my understanding of the subject, but may end up being
helpful to others too.
