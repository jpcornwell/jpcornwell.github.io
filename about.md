My name is Jacob Cornwell and I spend most of my time trying to learn new
things.

I currently work as a software engineer for the Bombardier Flight Test Center
where I write and maintain mission critical software used for the testing and
certification of experimental type aircraft.

Here is a link to my github profile.
