About Me
--------

My name is Jacob Cornwell and I spend most of my time trying to learn new
things.

I used to work as a software engineer for the Bombardier Flight Test Center
where I wrote and maintained mission critical software used for the testing and
certification of experimental type aircraft.

Now I work as a software engineer for NetApp on the E-Series Solutions team 
where I get to investigate new ideas and technologies for the purpose of 
boosting the value we provide to our customers.

Here is a link to my GitHub profile.

About the Website
-----------------

On this website you can expect to see three main types of content. Writeups,
demos, and articles.

Writeups are for me and are basically a log of the various projects I tackle.
This forces me to give a little bit of thought afterwards and the posts may
prove to be interesting to look back on in the future.

Demos will be my projects that are easily shown off through a browser. There
might be some fun things like games.

Articles will be in depth excursions into a given topic. They are again, mostly
for me, to help solidify my understanding of the subject, but may end up being
helpful to others too.
